# Secret Stuff

It is not uncommon for a website to have at least _some_ content that's free to consume.

And there comes a time in a site's life when it's time to have a premium offeringâ€“ Maybe it's a one-off sale. Maybe it's a subscription that renews every so often.

This project seeks to provide an example of a deployable web application built with the following:
* Next.js for static site generation.
* Firebase for authentication & data persistence.
* Stripe for all things ecommerce.

## Todos
[] Create new Next.js site
[] Configure data storage with Firebase
[] Configure authentication with Firebase
[] Configure Stripe to tell the site when it's okay to display content

...and write about every step as the "unknown unknowns" emerge!
